<H2>Dacon Competition: Fake Voice Detection</H2>

<p align="center">
  <H3>
    This project involves developing a model to detect fake voice. <br>
    The goal is to build a high-performance model using labeled data.
  </H3>
  <br>
  <H3>
    The labeled dataset is too large to upload to Git, <br>
    so I have only uploaded the main code.
